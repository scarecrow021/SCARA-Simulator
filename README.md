# SCARA-Simulator
An attempt to make 2D SCARA simulator with Qt GUI.

To build this: 
1) Install Qt 5 and keep all the folders, files and libraries in a directory named 'Qt'.
2) Install Visual Studio Community 2019, ensuring development environment C++. You need MSVC 2019 for compilation.
3) Install CMAKE, latest.
4) Clone this repo, and inside the repo make a folder named 'build'.
5) Open Cmake Gui and select source as repo and build as the folder 'build'.
6) Before Configuring-> click on QT_DIR and browse for the folder '/Qt/5.15.2/msvc2019_64'.
7) Configure -> Choose Visual Studio 2019 -> Compiler x64 -> Generate -> Open
8) Build in Visual Studio and Start a new instance
9) Viola!!

If something does not work, please try to find your own soution to make it work since all source files are readily available. 

Thank you...
